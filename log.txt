# v0.0.8 created on Jan. 26, 2012
#  (1) made changes according to Rui's and Brian's comments
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#1)      Name of the functions: how about csi.est and augcsi.est ?
#
#2)      Order of the functions, please put csi.est first then augcsi.est
#
#3)      Description: The package contains functions for estimating incidence
#rate from assay-based cross-sectional studies
#
#4)      In the Description for Cal.incidenceB (page 1), please change
#"cross-section" to "cross-sectional".
#
#5)      Page 2, in the Arguments, for N1, please put "(e.g., ELISA)" after
#"sensitive test", and similarly for n1, put  "(e.g., BED)" after
#"less-sensitive
#test"  for the first time they appear.
#
#6)      Page 2, in the Arguments, for n0, add "indefinitely" at the end of
#sentence, right before ";".
#
#7)      Page 2, in the Arguments, please replace "patients" with "subjects"
#throughout.
#
#8)      Page 2, in the Arguments, please remove "at baseline" throughout.
#
#9)      Page 2, in the Arguments, for ftime, in the parentheses, please change
#to "(time from cross-sectional sample to first positive result on
#less-sensitive
#test or end of follow-up, whichever occurs first)".
#
#10)   Page 2, in the details, I am not sure if I understand what is currently
#written, don't we know the length of follow-up? Do we assume that if they have
#not become positive at the end of study follow-up, then they are long-term
#non-progressors?
#
#11)    Page 2, in "value", please change "at baseline" to "at the time of
#cross-sectional sample".
#
#12)   Page 2, in "value", at the end of description for "incidence.CI", please
#change the last sentence to "This interval is symmetric about
#log(\hat{\lambda}), and not about\hat{\mabda}".
#
#13)   Please use rwang@hsph.harvard.edu <mailto:rwang@hsph.harvard.edu>  as my
#email address.
#
#14)   Page 3, in the "examples", the comments for "interval=2", please add
#units, such as "interval between follow-up visits, in weeks".
#
#15)   Page 3, in the "examples", can you add a few more comments, to separate
#the part about generating such datasets and then apply the cal.incidence
#function? Also, the comments for the two cases with p=1 and p<1, let's not
#label
#them as "Estimator A" and "Estimator B", but instead just say "p=1; in the
#absence of long-term non-progressors", and "p<1; in the presence of long-term
#non-progressors".
#
#16)   Page 3, in the description for csi, please change it to "Estimating
#incidence rate from assay-based cross-sectional studies, allowing for a
#subpopulation that remains negative on the less-sensitive assay indefinitely."
#
#17)   Page 4, In the Arguments, can we change the arguments (n1 to N1, n2 to
#N2,
#n3 to N3) to be consistent with augcsi.est?
#
#18)   Page 4, please add "e.g., BED" after the less-sensitive test the first
#time we mention it.
#
#19)   Page 4, in the Arguments, please change "reactive" or "non-reactive" to
#"testing positive" and "testing negative" to be consistent.
#
#20)   Page 4, in the Arguments, for "p", please change the last sentence to
#"p=1
#corresponds to the setting where all infected subjects will test positive on
#the
#less-sensitive test".
#
#21)   Page 4, in the Arguments for "sd.mu" and "sd.p", should we say "standard
#error" rather than "standard deviation"? also, please change the sentence to
#the
#following: "standard error of an externally-estimated \hat{mu}." Similarly for
#"sd.p". To this end, I also wonder whether we can change the sd.mu and sd.p to
#se.mu and se.p to be consistent with se.est.
#
#22)   For ci.95, can we just use incidence.ci to be consistent with
#augcsi.est?
#also let user specify the coverage level ?
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------
#Let¢s do the easy one first  for the names of these 2 functions, perhaps we
#could call them csi.r and csiaug.r? this way csi.r would come first?
# 
#Now I understand what you mean with the upper bound. So in the p<1 case, we
#assume that those who have not become positive at the end of follow-up are
#long-term non-progressors; but for the p=1 case, if they have not become
#positive at the end of follow-up, they are censored. It just occur to me that
#for p=1 case, this can also happen if someone is lost to follow up; but in p<1
#case, it is unclear how to handle lost to follow up.
# 
#Because of this, what do you and Weiliang think if we change the Argument for
#¡, the part in parentheses, to the following:
# 
#´time from cross-sectional sample to first positive result on less-sensitive
#test¡
# 
#And leave the ´Details¡ on page 2 as the way it is to avoid confusion.

#  (1) update the manual file for the function 'csi'
#
# v0.0.6 created on Nov. 30, 2011
#  (1) add function 'csi'
#
# v0.0.5 created on Nov. 21, 2011

#      the function  'L3w' to 'f2', 'fkg2', and 'F2'
#  (7) rename function 'mu' to 'muFunc' to distinguish function 'mu' and variable 'mu'
#  (8) add inputs 'ai', 'bi', and 'n1' to the function 'L3w'
